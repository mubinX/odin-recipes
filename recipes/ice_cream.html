        <h3>The Only Ice Cream Recipe You'll Ever Need</h3>

        <p>This silky, luscious and very classic custard can be used as the base for any ice cream flavor you can dream up. These 
        particular proportions of milk and cream to egg yolk will give you a thick but not sticky ice cream that feels decadent 
        but not heavy. For something a little lighter, use more milk and less cream, as long as the dairy adds up to 3 cups. You 
        can also cut down on egg yolks for a thinner base, but don't go below three.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Yield: About 1½ pints</li>
            <li>2cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1cup whole milk</li>
            <li>⅔cup sugar</li>
            <li>⅛teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>6large egg yolks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, 
                sugar and salt until sugar completely 
                dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove pot 
                from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk 
                yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk 
                about a third of the hot cream into the 
                yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back 
                into the pot with the cream. Return pot 
                to medium-low heat and gently cook until 
                mixture is thick enough to coat the back 
                of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an 
                instant-read thermometer).</li>
            
            <li>Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a 
                bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. 
                Cover and chill at least 4 hours or 
                overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine 
                according to manufacturers instructions. 
                Serve directly from the machine for soft 
                serve, or store in freezer until needed.
